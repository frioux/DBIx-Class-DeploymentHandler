=method initialize

 $dh->initialize({
   version      => 1,
   storage_type => 'SQLite'
 });

Run scripts before deploying to the database

=method prepare_deploy

 $dh->prepare_deploy

Generate the needed data files to install the schema to the database.

=method deploy

 $dh->deploy({ version => 1 })

Deploy the schema to the database.

=method prepare_resultsource_install

 $dh->prepare_resultsource_install({
   result_source => $resultset->result_source,
 })

Takes a L<DBIx::Class::ResultSource> and generates a single migration file to
create the resultsource's table.

=method install_resultsource

 $dh->install_resultsource({
   result_source => $resultset->result_source,
   version       => 1,
 })

Takes a L<DBIx::Class::ResultSource> and runs a single migration file to
deploy the resultsource's table.

=method prepare_upgrade

 $dh->prepare_upgrade({
   from_version => 1,
   to_version   => 2,
   version_set  => [1, 2]
 });

Takes two versions and a version set.  This basically is supposed to generate
the needed C<SQL> to migrate up from the first version to the second version.
The version set uniquely identifies the migration.

=method prepare_downgrade

 $dh->prepare_downgrade({
   from_version => 1,
   to_version   => 2,
   version_set  => [1, 2]
 });

Takes two versions and a version set.  This basically is supposed to generate
the needed C<SQL> to migrate down from the first version to the second version.
The version set uniquely identifies the migration and should match its
respective upgrade version set.

=method upgrade_single_step

 my ($ddl, $sql) = @{
   $dh->upgrade_single_step({ version_set => $version_set })
 ||[]}

Call a single upgrade migration.  Takes a version set as an argument.
Optionally return C<< [ $ddl, $upgrade_sql ] >> where C<$ddl> is the DDL for
that version of the schema and C<$upgrade_sql> is the SQL that was run to
upgrade the database.

=method downgrade_single_step

 $dh->downgrade_single_step($version_set);

Call a single downgrade migration.  Takes a version set as an argument.
Optionally return C<< [ $ddl, $upgrade_sql ] >> where C<$ddl> is the DDL for
that version of the schema and C<$upgrade_sql> is the SQL that was run to
upgrade the database.
