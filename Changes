       - Allow user to specify version of schema to install
       - Added better sandboxing (stolen straight from Plack::Util) for coderefs

       - Added DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::DeployMethod::SQL::Translator::ScriptHelpers,

       - Add basic intro (norkakn)

       - Better defaults and cascading for Logging

0.001000_10 2010-05-18 00:07:31 CST6CDT

0.001000_07 2010-05-09 01:59:59 CST6CDT
       - Downgrades swap from version and to version, so instead of up 1-2
         being down 1-2, it's down 2-1, which clearly makes more sense
       - perl scripts are now just anonymous subroutines, instead of files
         with a single run subroutine
       - Serious changes to architecture by using MXRP instead
         of lots of repetitive roles
