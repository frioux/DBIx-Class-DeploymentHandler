0.002200  2012-08-02 20:48:52 America/Chicago
  - Added helpful logging for the schema_from_schema_loader ScriptHelper
  - Added much more helpful error for "Can't find source for..." error in
    migration scripts, based on code from DBIx::Class::Migration
  - Test suite now is fully parallelizable
  - Switch ::ScriptHelpers to Sub::Exporter::Progressive
  - Switch from Test::Exception to Test::Fatal

0.002115  2012-07-10 13:36:35 America/Chicago
  - Make tests use actual temp files to make certain systems stop failing tests
  - Remove dep on File::Touch

0.002114  2012-05-07 08:05:20 America/Chicago
  - Correctly set the version deployed to the version requested on install
    instead of just the current schema version

0.002113  2012-05-05 23:09:33 America/Chicago
  - Remove isa check on schema attributes so that you may pass the schema
    class instead of the schema object

0.002112  2012-04-03 21:11:19 America/Chicago
  - Handle errors in Perl Scripts better
  - Stop supporting FindBin by localizing $0, just use Dir::Self if you

  - Improve docs by linking from implementations to their roles

0.002110  2012-03-14 21:22:36 America/Chicago
  - Use ->count instead of ->next to check if version storage is deployed
    (->next caused issues on MSSQL due to length of DDL)
  - Fix a couple stupid documentation issues (Phillip Smith)

0.002100  2012-03-03 17:09:21 CST6CDT
  - Wrap upgrades, downgrades, and installs in a transaction, as a failure
    to add a version to the version table should cause a rollback
  - Allow user to specify version of schema to install
  - Added better sandboxing (stolen straight from Plack::Util) for coderefs
    to avoid accidental leakage
  - Sandboxing also makes $0 and thus FindBin et al work in perl scripts

0.002000  2012-02-28 21:20:48 CST6CDT
  - Added DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::DeployMethod::SQL::Translator::ScriptHelpers,
    ALL users who use perl scripts during migrations are encouraged to use
    schema_from_schema_loader from that package.

0.001008  2012-02-19 10:12:34 CST6CDT
  - Added dep on parent, bump dep on DBD::SQLite to avoid silly failures

0.001006  2012-02-01 21:18:38 CST6CDT

0.001002  2010-07-07 21:11:45 CST6CDT

    where it would try to install the version storage table twice, which
    breaks everything

    situations

0.001001  2010-06-26 10:46:03 CST6CDT

0.001000_13 2010-06-01 23:30:15 CST6CDT
  - No more serialized SQL, we serialize the SQLT schema instead
  - Completely reorganize the name of directories for more user friendlyness
  - take out support for _generic since it's against my creed

  - Add missing dep namespace::autoclean

0.001000_07 2010-05-09 01:59:59 CST6CDT
  - Downgrades swap from version and to version, so instead of up 1-2
    being down 1-2, it's down 2-1, which clearly makes more sense
  - perl scripts are now just anonymous subroutines, instead of files
    with a single run subroutine
  - Serious changes to architecture by using MXRP instead
    of lots of repetitive roles

    version of the schema

    version storage
